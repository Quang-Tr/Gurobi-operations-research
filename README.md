# Linear optimization with Gurobi

In the course "Einf√ºhrung in Operations Research / Quantitative Methoden 2021", I used the [Gurobi solver](https://www.gurobi.com/) through its Python interface to model 4 optimization problems as linear programs.
The only required module is `gurobipy`.

For each problem, there are 2 test files containing sample data besides the main model file.
The optimal objective values can be found under the problem description (in German).
